      # Note: sccache is intentionally NOT used here because cargo-tarpaulin
      # needs direct control over the compilation process to instrument code
      # for coverage collection. Using RUSTC_WRAPPER breaks tarpaulin.
      #
      # Multi-process network tests are skipped because:
      # 1. They spawn external processes which doesn't work well under instrumentation
      # 2. The overhead causes timeouts (default 60s is insufficient)
      # 3. These tests are thoroughly exercised in ci-network.yml with proper timeouts
      #
      # --exclude-files removes code from coverage report
      # -- --skip multi_process passes skip argument to test executable
