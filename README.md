> **🤖 AI-Assisted Development Notice**
>
> This project was developed with **substantial AI assistance**. The vast majority of the code, documentation, tests, and formal specifications were written with the help of **Claude Opus 4.5** and **Codex 5.1**. Human oversight was provided for code review, architectural decisions, and final approval, but the implementation work was heavily AI-driven. This transparency is provided so users can make informed decisions about using this crate.

> ⚠️⚠️⚠️
> WARNING
> ⚠️⚠️⚠️
>
> This crate is currently in alpha state as I start integrating it with some in-development game projects. I will utilize `semver` to the best of my ability to help guard against breaking changes. The main goal of this is to provide a robust, easy-to-use, 100% reliable rollback engine for games. As such, there may be anywhere between "zero" API changes and "complete overhauls". This readme and the version will be updated appropriately as things stabilize.

## P2P Rollback Networking in Rust

Fortress Rollback is a correctness-first peer-to-peer rollback networking library for deterministic multiplayer games, written in 100% safe [Rust 🦀](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`). It is engineered for reliability: zero panics in production code, determinism by construction, extensive property and fuzz testing, and formal verification (TLA+, Kani, Z3) of its trickiest invariants. The callback-style API common to rollback libraries is replaced with a simple, request-driven control flow — instead of registering callbacks, you advance the session and fulfill the list of requests it returns.

Fortress Rollback began as a fortified fork of the excellent [`ggrs`](https://github.com/gschup/ggrs) crate — itself inspired by the [GGPO](https://www.ggpo.net/) network SDK — and has since grown its own capabilities, including graceful peer drop, runtime input delay, redundant-host spectators, and hot-join. Migrating from `ggrs`? See [Migration from ggrs](#migration-from-ggrs) below.

Questions, bug reports, or feature ideas are welcome on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/wallstop/fortress-rollback/issues).

## Interactive Examples

Fortress Rollback includes interactive game examples built with [macroquad](https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad). Run them locally to see rollback networking in action:

```shell
# P2P session (run in two terminals with different ports)
cargo run --example ex_game_p2p --features graphical-examples -- --local-port 7000 --players localhost 127.0.0.1:7001
cargo run --example ex_game_p2p --features graphical-examples -- --local-port 7001 --players 127.0.0.1:7000 localhost

# Sync test (determinism verification)
cargo run --example ex_game_synctest --features graphical-examples -- --num-players 2 --check-distance 7
```

See the [examples README](./examples/README.md) for system dependencies and more options.

## Getting Started

To get started with Fortress Rollback, check out the following resources:

- 📖 **[User Guide](https://wallstop.github.io/fortress-rollback/)** — Full documentation site with guides, architecture, and API reference
- 📚 **[GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/wallstop/fortress-rollback/wiki)** — Quick reference and community-editable docs
- 💻 **[Examples](./examples/)** — Working code examples for common use cases

- 📋 **[API Documentation](https://docs.rs/fortress-rollback/latest/fortress_rollback/)** — Auto-generated Rust docs on docs.rs

### System Dependencies for Examples

The interactive examples use [macroquad](https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad), which requires system libraries:

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**

```shell
sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev libx11-dev libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
```

**Linux (Fedora/RHEL):**

```shell
sudo dnf install alsa-lib-devel libX11-devel libXi-devel mesa-libGL-devel
```

**macOS/Windows:** No additional dependencies required.

## Development Status

Alpha / experimental only.

### Key Improvements in Fortress Rollback

- **100% Deterministic**: All collections use `BTreeMap`/`BTreeSet` for guaranteed iteration order; new `hash` module provides FNV-1a deterministic hashing
- **Panic-Free API**: All public APIs return `Result` types instead of panicking — no unexpected crashes
- **Correctness-First**: Formally verified with TLA+ and Z3 proofs; ~1600 tests (~92% coverage) including multi-process network and resilience scenarios
- **Enhanced Desync Detection**: Built-in checksum validation with `P2PSession::confirmed_inputs_for_frame()` for debugging state divergence
- **`handle_requests!` Macro**: Eliminates boilerplate in the game loop — see [User Guide](./docs/user-guide.md#using-the-handle_requests-macro)
- **Config Presets**: `SyncConfig::lan()`, `ProtocolConfig::mobile()`, etc. for common network conditions
- **Player Handle Convenience Methods**: Easy access to local/remote handles for 1v1 games, player type checking, and iteration — see [User Guide](./docs/user-guide.md#player-handle-convenience-methods)
- **Unified Session Trait**: Write generic game loops via `Session<T>` — works with P2P, spectator, and sync test sessions — see [User Guide](./docs/user-guide.md#using-the-session-trait)
- **Runtime Input Delay**: Adjust per-player input delay mid-session via `P2PSession::set_input_delay` for hybrid delay+rollback netcode — see [User Guide](./docs/user-guide.md#adjusting-input-delay-at-runtime)
- **Graceful Peer Drop**: Configure `DisconnectBehavior::ContinueWithout` so the session keeps advancing for surviving peers, or remove a peer explicitly with `P2PSession::remove_player` (kick / surrender / leave-match) — see [User Guide](./docs/user-guide.md#disconnect-behavior-and-graceful-peer-drop)

### Network Requirements

| Condition | Supported | Optimal |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| RTT | <200ms | <100ms |
| Packet Loss | <15% | <5% |
| Jitter | <50ms | <20ms |

For detailed configuration guidance, see the [User Guide](./docs/user-guide.md#network-requirements).

### Feature Flags

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `sync-send` | Adds `Send + Sync` bounds for multi-threaded game engines (e.g., Bevy) |
| `hot-join` | Allows a peer to join/rejoin a running session by filling a reserved or gracefully-dropped slot via a state snapshot (requires `Config::State: Serialize + DeserializeOwned`; player count stays fixed) |
| `tokio` | Enables `TokioUdpSocket` for async Tokio applications |
| `paranoid` | Runtime invariant checking in release builds |
| `graphical-examples` | Enables ex_game graphical examples (requires macroquad deps) |
| `loom` | Loom-compatible synchronization primitives for concurrency testing |
| `json` | JSON serialization for telemetry types (`to_json()` methods) |
| `z3-verification` | Enables Z3 SMT solver proofs (development/CI only — requires Z3 installed) |
| `z3-verification-bundled` | Like `z3-verification` but builds Z3 from source (slow, no system Z3 needed) |

For detailed feature documentation, see the [User Guide](./docs/user-guide.md#feature-flags).

## Migration from ggrs

Moving from the original `ggrs` crate? See the step-by-step guide in [migration.md](./docs/migration.md). It covers the crate rename (`fortress-rollback`), the new `Config::Address` `Ord` bound, and import changes (`fortress_rollback`).

### Web / WASM Support

Fortress Rollback works in the browser! WASM support is **automatic** — no feature flags needed. The library detects `target_arch = "wasm32"` at compile time and uses browser-compatible APIs (`web_time` for timing, `js_sys::Date` for epoch timestamps).

For networking in the browser, use **[Matchbox](https://github.com/johanhelsing/matchbox)** — it provides WebRTC sockets that implement `NonBlockingSocket` and work seamlessly with Fortress Rollback:

```toml
[dependencies]
fortress-rollback = "0.9"
matchbox_socket = { version = "0.13", features = ["ggrs"] }
```

> **Note:** The `ggrs` feature of `matchbox_socket` implements the **original GGRS crate's** `NonBlockingSocket` trait, not Fortress Rollback's. You'll need a thin adapter wrapper to bridge the two traits. See the [custom socket example](./examples/custom_socket.rs) for the recommended approach to implementing your own `NonBlockingSocket`.

Matchbox handles:

- **WebRTC peer-to-peer connections** — direct data channels between browsers
- **Signaling server** — connection establishment (only needed during setup)
- **Cross-platform** — works on native and WASM with the same API

See the [custom socket example](./examples/custom_socket.rs) for implementing your own transport (WebSockets, custom protocols, etc.)
