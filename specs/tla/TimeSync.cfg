SPECIFICATION Spec

\* Use small values for tractable model checking
\* Production uses WINDOW_SIZE=30, but we use 2 for exhaustive checking
\* These values are deliberately minimal to ensure fast CI runs while
\* still verifying the key invariants hold
CONSTANT WINDOW_SIZE = 2
CONSTANT MAX_FRAME = 3
CONSTANT MAX_ADVANTAGE = 1
CONSTANT NUM_PEERS = 2
CONSTANT NULL_FRAME = 999

CONSTRAINT StateConstraint

\* Safety invariants to verify
INVARIANT TypeInvariant
INVARIANT AverageBounded
INVARIANT WindowConsistency
INVARIANT DeterministicAverage
INVARIANT SymmetricAdvantageProperty

\* Liveness checking is expensive; can be enabled for deeper analysis
\* PROPERTY AverageEventuallyComputed
